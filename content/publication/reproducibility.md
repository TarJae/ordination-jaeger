This workshop will introduce some version control strategies that can increase the reproducibility of your work. Learning through hands-on exercises you will harness two specific tools (Git and RStudio) to support the execution of more reproducible research projects. Git is a powerful version control system and RStudio is an open-source statistical software program. No previous experience with Git or R is required for this workshop. "
