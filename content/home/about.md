# Biography

John is a Data Science Librarian/Consultant working in the [Data & Visualization Services Department](//library.duke.edu/data).  I help Duke University students and researchers navigate practical data science challenges.  To that end I provide a series of *workshops* on *R* and *OpenRefine*; offer walk-in and by-appointment consultations; and host the *R we having fun yet* learning series ([Rfun](//rfun.library.duke.edu/)). 

My [workshops](#publications_selected) and [presentations](#presentations) include twitter stream gathering, web scraping, data parsing, and data cleaning. Each workshop is designed as a hands-on experience where you can download  practice data, presentation slides, and workbook guides.  Recorded video streaming is often available.
