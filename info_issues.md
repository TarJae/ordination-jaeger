# Problems during work

## Issue on mobile 
If 5th post in posts and View is compact then there is a space at the left side of the site. 
Main issue was a broad picture in gallery. Additionally changed View of posts from compact to cards.

## two lines in menu:
If there are more than 8 words in the menu, then names with two words will be written in two lines. Solution remove words.
