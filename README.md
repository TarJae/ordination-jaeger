How to Build this site manually

1. [If starting from scratch...] Clone the github repo into RStudio  

    - My preferred method of making new repos as RStuio Projects...
    
        1. Start at Github.com > New Repo
        1. Clone [new & empty] Repo as new project into Rstudio IDE running on localhost
        1. git push -- README.md, license.md, and .gitignore
    
2. `library(blogdown)` [Resources:  [github](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), [Yihui's Book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)]

    - Dependencies:
    
        - `devtools::install_github('rstudio/blogdown')`
        - `blogdown::install_hugo()`
            - only need to do this once, but...
            - might need to, occasionally but not initially, run `blogdown::update_hugo()`
        - `blogdown::new_site(theme = "gcushen/hugo-academic")` 
            - must be a completely empty directory except for .Rproj file
            - view [other theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/) options
                - See [Yihui's recommendation](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown#blogdown) of selecting one of only a few workable themes for newbies
    
3. `blogdown::serve_site()`
4. Edit via *Rmarkdown* or *markdown* in the `content` directory and subdirs

    - Initially, you will have edited the `config.toml`, plus `layouts`, and `static` directories (e.g. CSS, templates, etc. and such)
    
5. Make customizations and stylistic (i.e. non-content) changes (CSS, see ["*static*"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/templates.html)) in the `static` directory, where the sub-hierarchy of `static` mirrors the sub-hierarchy into `public` 

    - Do not need to mirror the entire sub-hieary.  Customize/mirror only as necessary and appropriate.
    
5. Override `layouts` by ghosting the `themes/../layouts/...` sub-hiearchy into the `layouts` directory.  See [custom-layours documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/custom-layouts.html)

5. Deployment on [Netlify](http://netlify.com)  

    - For Manual Deployment, Optionally stop blogdown server.  Drag `public` directory to netlify.com deploy
    - For Continuous Depolyment, set up according to the [Netlify Docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/) pointing to the `/public` of an appropriate github repository.

        - I used Command = `hugo_0.19`.  I Probably need to follow the [additional steps](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/04/11/netlify-plus-hugo-0.20-and-beyond/) for beyond version 0.20, but version 0.19 works and it was easiest.

## ISSUES

- At least on Windows in RStudio (in my experience), trying to use RStudio to git add the `static` and `themes` directories will cause **git** to **hang** or **freeze** within the GIT *GUI* tab.  This may be because there are a large number of files within those directories.  To fix this kill RStudio; delete .git/lock-file ; goto CLI Shell (i.e. gitbash) and manually add `static` and `themes` (i.e. `git add static .`)


## Notes

### In Customizing Projects to Presentations

added files to  

- content/presentation
- content/home/presentations.md
- layouts/presentation/
- layouts/partials/widgets/presentations.html

    - {{ range $project := where $.Data.Pages "Type" "**presentation**" }}
    
### Stub .md file
- `blogdown::new_content("workshop/test_workshop1.md", kind = "publication")`  # doesn't completely work as I would expect but it's useful to know this command (maybe)   


### Obscure fact about blogdown environment variables

- `{{ printf "%#v" .}}`
